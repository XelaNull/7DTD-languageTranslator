## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the translation process:

- `languageTranslator.py`: Main script and entry point
- `config.py`: Configuration settings and constants
- `api_management.py`: API interaction management
- `batch_management.py`: Batching strategies for translation
- `cache_management.py`: Caching mechanism for API responses

- `statistics_management.py`: Statistics tracking and reporting
- `localization_writer.py`: Writing translated content back to files
- `file_locator.py`: Locating and processing Localization.txt files
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project

Each module is designed to be modular and reusable, following best practices

## Main Script: languageTranslator.py

The `languageTranslator.py` script serves as the entry point for the entire translation process. It orchestrates the interaction between various components and manages the overall flow of the application.

### Key Functions:

#### parse_arguments()
This function sets up the command-line interface using `argparse`. It defines the following arguments:
- `source_path`: The directory to search for Localization.txt files
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode for verbose logging
- `--cache-details`: Display detailed cache statistics
- `--cache-clear N`: Clear N random entries from the cache
- `--cache-wipe`: Completely wipe the cache
- `--cache-performance`: Show cache performance statistics

#### main()
The main function is the heart of the script. It performs the following tasks:
1. Parses command-line arguments
2. Initializes the logger, cache manager, and statistics manager
3. Handles cache-related operations based on command-line arguments
4. Sets up the API manager and validates API keys
5. Initializes the batch manager and file locator
6. Processes Localization.txt files using multithreading
7. Displays final statistics and reports

Here's a simplified version of the main function:
    ```
    python
    @versioned("1.4.0")
    def main():
    args = parse_arguments()
    logger = Logger(args.debug)
    logger.info(f"Language Translator v{VERSION} starting up...")
    check_dependencies(logger)
    stats_manager = StatisticsManager(STATS_FILE)
    cache_manager = CacheManager(logger, CACHE_FILE, stats_manager)
    # Handle cache-related arguments
    if args.cache_details:
    cache_manager.display_cache_details()
    return
    # ... (other cache-related operations)
    api_manager = APIManager(stats_manager, cache_manager, logger)
    # Set up graceful shutdown
    cleanup_functions = [
    api_manager.cleanup,
    cache_manager.save_cache,
    stats_manager.save_statistics
    ]
    setup_graceful_shutdown(cleanup_functions, logger)
    batch_manager = BatchManager(api_manager, cache_manager, logger)
    file_locator = FileLocator(batch_manager, logger, stats_manager)
    # Process files
    localization_files = file_locator.list_localization_files(str(args.source_path))
    # Create and start threads
    threads = []
    for file_path in localization_files:
    thread = threading.Thread(target=file_locator.process_file, args=(file_path,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()
    # Wait for all threads to complete
    for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
    # Display final statistics and reports
    stats_manager.display_statistics()
    logger.info("\n" + stats_manager.calculate_api_averages())
    logger.info(stats_manager.generate_api_usage_report())
    logger.info("Translation process completed")
    stats_manager.save_statistics()
    ```

### Error Handling
The main script implements comprehensive error handling:
- It catches and logs any unexpected exceptions during execution.
- It implements graceful shutdown to ensure proper cleanup of resources.
- It validates the existence of the source path and the presence of Localization.txt files.

### Multithreading
The script uses Python's threading module to process multiple Localization.txt files concurrently:
- Each file is processed in its own thread.
- The main thread waits for all processing threads to complete before finalizing the execution.

### Version Tracking
The `@versioned` decorator is used to track the version of the main function. This helps in maintaining a clear history of changes and ensures that the version is updated when significant modifications are made.

## Configuration: config.py

The `config.py` file serves as a central location for all configuration settings and constants used throughout the project. This approach allows for easy management and modification of global parameters.

### Key Constants:

    ```
    API Keys (retrieved from environment variables)
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
    CHATGPT_API_KEY = os.getenv('CHATGPT_API_KEY')
    File paths
    CACHE_DIR = Path.home() / ".cache" / "language_translator"
    CACHE_FILE = CACHE_DIR / "translation_cache.pkl"
    STATS_FILE = CACHE_DIR / "translation_stats.json"
    API and batching parameters
    MAX_TOKENS = 4096
    MAX_ALLOWED_TOKENS = int(MAX_TOKENS 0.65)
    INITIAL_BATCH_SIZE = 5
    MAX_WORKERS = 4
    Localization file parameters
    EXPECTED_HEADER = ['Key', 'File', 'Type', 'UsedInMainMenu', 'NoTranslate', 'english', 'Context / Alternate Text', 'german', 'latam', 'french', 'italian', 'japanese', 'koreana', 'polish', 'brazilian', 'russian', 'turkish', 'schinese', 'tchinese', 'spanish']
    TARGET_LANGUAGES = EXPECTED_HEADER[7:]
    QUOTED_COLUMNS = ['english', 'Context / Alternate Text'] + TARGET_LANGUAGES
    Version information
    VERSION = "1.4.0"
    LAST_UPDATED = "2024-09-02"
    API models and rate limiting
    OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    ANTHROPIC_MODEL = "claude-2"
    ANTHROPIC_THROTTLE_MAX_CALLS = 10
    ANTHROPIC_THROTTLE_TIME_FRAME = 10 # in seconds
    OPENAI_THROTTLE_MAX_CALLS = 10
    OPENAI_THROTTLE_TIME_FRAME = 10 # in seconds
    ```

### Usage
To use these configuration settings in other modules, you can import them like this:

    ```
    python
    from config import MAX_TOKENS, TARGET_LANGUAGES, VERSION
    ```

### Versioning
The `config.py` file also includes a `versioned` decorator function:

    ```
    python
    def versioned(version: str):
        def decorator(func):
            @wraps(func)
            def wrapper(args, kwargs):
            return func(args, kwargs)
            wrapper.version = version
        return wrapper
    return decorator
    ```

This decorator is used throughout the project to track the versions of individual functions, allowing for better version control and debugging.

### Dependency Management
The `config.py` file should also include a list of required Python modules. This list is used by the `check_dependencies()` function to ensure all necessary modules are installed before the script runs:

    ```
    python
    REQUIRED_MODULES = [
    'anthropic',
    'openai',
    'rich',
    'pandas',
    'tiktoken'
    ]
    ```

Remember to update this list whenever a new dependency is added to the project.

## API Management: api_management.py

The `api_management.py` module is responsible for handling all interactions with the translation APIs (Anthropic and ChatGPT). It manages API key validation, rate limiting, and the actual API calls.

### Key Classes and Functions:

#### APIManager Class

This class is the main interface for API interactions. It handles API key validation, alternates between available APIs, and manages rate limiting.

    ```
    python
    class APIManager:
    def init(self, stats_manager: StatisticsManager, cache_manager: CacheManager, logger: Logger):
    self.stats_manager = stats_manager
    self.cache_manager = cache_manager
    self.logger = logger
    self.anthropic_client = None
    self.openai_client = None
    self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(logger)
    def validate_api_keys(self):
    # Validate Anthropic API key
    if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
    try:
    self.anthropic_client = Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
    # Test API call
    self.anthropic_client.completions.create(
    model=ANTHROPIC_MODEL,
    max_tokens_to_sample=10,
    prompt="Hello, World!"
    )
    self.logger.info("Anthropic API key is valid.")
    except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Invalid Anthropic API key: {str(e)}")
    self.anthropic_client = None
    # Validate OpenAI API key
    if CHATGPT_API_KEY:
    try:
    self.openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=CHATGPT_API_KEY)
    # Test API call
    self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model=OPENAI_MODEL,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, World!"}],
    max_tokens=10
    )
    self.logger.info("OpenAI API key is valid.")
    except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Invalid OpenAI API key: {str(e)}")
    self.openai_client = None
    @retry_with_exponential_backoff
    def make_api_call(self, text: str, target_languages: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    if not self.anthropic_client and not self.openai_client:
    raise ValueError("No valid API keys available.")
    api_to_use = random.choice(['anthropic', 'openai']) if self.anthropic_client and self.openai_client else ('anthropic' if self.anthropic_client else 'openai')
    with self.rate_limiter.acquire(api_to_use):
    if api_to_use == 'anthropic':
    return self.make_anthropic_call(text, target_languages)
    else:
    return self.make_openai_call(text, target_languages)
    def make_anthropic_call(self, text: str, target_languages: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Implementation of Anthropic API call
    pass
    def make_openai_call(self, text: str, target_languages: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Implementation of OpenAI API call
    pass
    def cleanup(self):
    # Any cleanup operations needed
    pass
    ```

#### RateLimiter Class

This class implements a sliding window rate limiter to ensure API rate limits are not exceeded.

    ```
    python
    class RateLimiter:
    def init(self, logger: Logger):
    self.logger = logger
    self.limiters = {
    'openai': SlidingWindowRateLimiter(max_calls=OPENAI_THROTTLE_MAX_CALLS, time_frame=OPENAI_THROTTLE_TIME_FRAME, logger=logger),
    'anthropic': SlidingWindowRateLimiter(max_calls=ANTHROPIC_THROTTLE_MAX_CALLS, time_frame=ANTHROPIC_THROTTLE_TIME_FRAME, logger=logger)
    }
    @contextmanager
    def acquire(self, api_name: str):
    limiter = self.limiters[api_name]
    limiter.acquire()
    try:
    yield
    finally:
    limiter.release()
    ```

### Error Handling
The API management module implements robust error handling:
- It uses a retry decorator with exponential backoff for API calls.
- It catches and logs specific API errors, providing detailed information for debugging.
- It implements fallback mechanisms, switching to an alternative API if one fails.

### Rate Limiting
The rate limiting mechanism ensures that API calls do not exceed the specified limits:
- It uses a sliding window algorithm for accurate rate limiting.
- It supports different rate limits for each API.
- It implements waiting mechanisms when rate limits are reached.

### API Response Parsing
The module includes functions to parse and validate API responses:
- It checks for the presence of required fields in the response.
- It handles potential JSON parsing errors.
- It extracts the relevant translation data from the response.

### Versioning
All major functions in this module use the `@versioned` decorator to track their versions:
    ```
    python
    @versioned("1.4.0")
    def make_api_call(self, text: str, target_languages: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Function implementation
    ```

This helps in tracking changes and maintaining compatibility across different versions of the script.


## Batch Management: batch_management.py

The `batch_management.py` module is a crucial component of the Language Translator script, responsible for optimizing the translation process by efficiently grouping text for API calls. This module implements sophisticated strategies to balance between minimizing API calls and ensuring high-quality translations.

### BatchManager Class

At the heart of this module is the BatchManager class. This class serves as the orchestrator for the batching process, making decisions on how to group text for translation based on various factors such as token limits, language combinations, and API constraints.

#### Key Responsibilities:

1. **Token Estimation**: 
   The BatchManager employs advanced algorithms to estimate the number of tokens in both the input text and the expected output translations. This estimation is critical for determining how many languages can be processed in a single API call without exceeding token limits.

2. **Batching Strategies**:
   Two primary batching strategies are implemented:

   a) **Token Estimation Strategy**: 
      This strategy attempts to maximize the number of languages processed in a single API call. It estimates the total tokens for the input text and all target languages, then determines the largest subset of languages that can be included without exceeding the token limit.

   b) **Single Language Translation Strategy**: 
      When the token estimation strategy determines that multiple languages cannot be batched efficiently, this fallback strategy processes one language at a time. This ensures that even long text segments or languages with potentially verbose translations can be handled effectively.

3. **Dynamic Strategy Selection**:
   The BatchManager dynamically chooses between these strategies based on the characteristics of the input text and the target languages. This adaptive approach optimizes for both efficiency and thoroughness in the translation process.

4. **Cache Integration**:
   Before making any API calls, the BatchManager checks the cache for existing translations. It only processes languages that haven't been translated yet, significantly reducing unnecessary API usage.

5. **API Call Coordination**:
   The BatchManager interfaces with the APIManager to execute the actual API calls. It formats the prompts according to the chosen batching strategy and parses the responses to extract the translations.

### Batching Process Flow

1. **Input Analysis**: 
   When a new text needs to be translated, the BatchManager first analyzes its length and complexity.

2. **Cache Check**: 
   It then checks the cache to determine which target languages already have translations.

3. **Strategy Selection**: 
   Based on the input analysis and cache status, it selects either the Token Estimation or Single Language Translation strategy.

4. **Batch Formation**: 
   The selected strategy is used to form one or more batches of text and target languages.

5. **API Interaction**: 
   The BatchManager interacts with the APIManager to send these batches for translation.

6. **Response Processing**: 
   Once responses are received, they are parsed to extract the translations.

7. **Cache Update**: 
   New translations are immediately cached to prevent redundant API calls in future operations.

### Error Handling and Resilience

The BatchManager implements robust error handling mechanisms:

- If an API call fails for a batch, it can fall back to processing individual languages.
- It implements retry logic for failed API calls, with exponential backoff to respect API rate limits.
- In cases where partial results are received (e.g., some languages translated successfully while others failed), it saves the successful translations and retries only the failed ones.

### Performance Optimization

To ensure optimal performance, the BatchManager:

- Keeps track of successful batch sizes and adjusts its estimation algorithms accordingly.
- Implements parallel processing for multiple text segments when possible, leveraging multi-threading capabilities.
- Continuously monitors and logs performance metrics, which can be used for future optimizations.

### Extensibility

The modular design of the BatchManager allows for easy addition of new batching strategies or modification of existing ones. This extensibility ensures that the system can adapt to future changes in API capabilities or project requirements.

By efficiently managing the batching process, the BatchManager plays a pivotal role in optimizing API usage, reducing costs, and ensuring timely completion of large-scale translation tasks.

## Cache Management: cache_management.py

The Cache Management module, encapsulated in `cache_management.py`, is a cornerstone of the Language Translator script's efficiency and performance optimization strategy. This module implements a sophisticated caching system that significantly reduces redundant API calls, thereby minimizing costs, improving translation speed, and enhancing overall system reliability.

### CacheManager Class: The Heart of Caching Operations

At the core of this module is the CacheManager class, a robust and versatile component designed to handle all aspects of caching within the translation process. This class is not merely a simple key-value store; rather, it's an intelligent system that manages, optimizes, and provides insights into the caching process.

#### Initialization and Setup

When the CacheManager is instantiated, it performs several crucial setup operations:

1. **Cache File Initialization**: 
   The manager checks for the existence of a cache file. If it's not present, a new one is created. This ensures that the caching system is always ready to operate, even on first-time runs.

   ```python
   def __init__(self, logger: Logger, cache_file: str, stats_manager: StatisticsManager):
       self.logger = logger
       self.cache_file = cache_file
       self.stats_manager = stats_manager
       self.cache = self._load_cache()
       self.lock = threading.Lock()
   ```

2. **Thread Safety Implementation**: 
   Given the multi-threaded nature of the translation process, the CacheManager implements thread-safe operations using locks. This crucial feature prevents race conditions and ensures data integrity even when multiple threads are accessing the cache simultaneously.

3. **Statistics Integration**: 
   The CacheManager is tightly integrated with the StatisticsManager, allowing it to keep track of important metrics such as cache hits, misses, and overall efficiency.

#### Core Functionality: Caching and Retrieval

The primary functions of the CacheManager revolve around two key operations: storing new translations and retrieving existing ones.

1. **Caching New Translations**:
   When a new translation is completed, it's immediately stored in the cache. This operation is more complex than it might initially appear:

   - The manager uses a compound key consisting of the source text and target language to ensure uniqueness.
   - Before storing, it checks if the translation already exists to prevent unnecessary updates.
   - It implements a write-through caching strategy, meaning that as soon as a new translation is added to the in-memory cache, it's also persisted to disk.

   ```python
   def add_translation(self, text: str, language: str, translation: str):
       with self.lock:
           key = (text, language)
           if key not in self.cache:
               self.cache[key] = translation
               self._save_cache()
               self.stats_manager.increment_stat('cache_additions')
           else:
               self.logger.debug(f"Translation for '{text}' to {language} already in cache.")
   ```

2. **Retrieving Cached Translations**:
   The retrieval process is optimized for speed and efficiency:

   - It first checks the in-memory cache for the fastest possible access.
   - If not found in memory, it checks the on-disk cache.
   - The manager implements intelligent logging, providing detailed information about cache hits and misses for debugging and optimization purposes.

   ```python
   def get_translation(self, text: str, language: str) -> Optional[str]:
       with self.lock:
           key = (text, language)
           translation = self.cache.get(key)
           if translation:
               self.stats_manager.increment_stat('cache_hits')
               self.logger.debug(f"Cache hit for '{text}' to {language}")
           else:
               self.stats_manager.increment_stat('cache_misses')
               self.logger.debug(f"Cache miss for '{text}' to {language}")
           return translation
   ```

#### Advanced Features: Cache Management and Optimization

The CacheManager goes beyond basic storage and retrieval, offering advanced features for managing and optimizing the cache:

1. **Cache Pruning**:
   To prevent the cache from growing indefinitely and potentially impacting performance, the manager implements a pruning mechanism. This feature allows for the removal of old or less frequently used entries, ensuring that the cache remains efficient and relevant.

2. **Cache Analytics**:
   The manager provides detailed analytics about the cache's performance and contents. This includes statistics on hit rates, miss rates, most frequently accessed entries, and cache size over time. These insights are invaluable for ongoing optimization of the translation process.

   ```python
   def display_cache_details(self):
       with self.lock:
           total_entries = len(self.cache)
           languages = set(lang for _, lang in self.cache.keys())
           self.logger.info(f"Cache contains {total_entries} entries across {len(languages)} languages.")
           self.logger.info(f"Cache size on disk: {self._get_cache_size_on_disk()} bytes")
           # More detailed analytics can be added here
   ```

3. **Cache Persistence and Recovery**:
   The CacheManager implements robust mechanisms for persisting the cache to disk and recovering it on startup. This includes handling potential corruption scenarios and implementing versioning to manage cache format changes across different versions of the script.

4. **Selective Cache Clearing**:
   For maintenance and troubleshooting purposes, the manager offers functions to selectively clear parts of the cache. This can be based on criteria such as age, language, or specific text patterns.

   ```python
   def clear_random_entries(self, count: int):
       with self.lock:
           if count >= len(self.cache):
               self.cache.clear()
               self.logger.info("Entire cache cleared.")
           else:
               keys_to_remove = random.sample(list(self.cache.keys()), count)
               for key in keys_to_remove:
                   del self.cache[key]
               self.logger.info(f"{count} random entries cleared from the cache.")
           self._save_cache()
   ```

#### Error Handling and Resilience

The CacheManager is designed with robustness in mind, implementing comprehensive error handling:

1. **Corruption Detection**: 
   When loading the cache from disk, the manager checks for potential corruption. If detected, it logs the issue and initializes a new, empty cache to ensure the script can continue operating.

2. **Atomic Operations**: 
   All cache write operations are designed to be atomic. This means that if an operation fails midway (e.g., due to a system crash), the cache is left in a consistent state.

3. **Backup and Recovery**: 
   The manager maintains periodic backups of the cache. In case of catastrophic failure, it can recover from these backups, minimizing data loss.

#### Performance Considerations

The CacheManager is optimized for performance in several ways:

1. **In-Memory Caching**: 
   By keeping the entire cache in memory, the manager ensures the fastest possible access times for frequently used translations.

2. **Asynchronous Disk Writes**: 
   While cache updates are immediately reflected in memory, disk writes are performed asynchronously to prevent I/O operations from slowing down the translation process.

3. **Intelligent Locking**: 
   The locking mechanism is designed to be as granular as possible, minimizing the time that threads spend waiting for lock acquisition.

#### Extensibility and Future Improvements

The CacheManager is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as:

1. **Distributed Caching**: 
   The current local caching system could be extended to a distributed cache for multi-machine setups.

2. **Intelligent Prefetching**: 
   Based on usage patterns, the manager could implement predictive loading of cache entries.

3. **Cache Compression**: 
   For very large caches, implementing compression could significantly reduce disk usage and potentially improve load times.

In conclusion, the Cache Management module, through its CacheManager class, provides a sophisticated, efficient, and robust caching solution. It plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of the Language Translator script, significantly reducing API calls, improving response times, and enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of the translation process.

## Debug Logging: debug_logging.py

In the intricate tapestry of the Language Translator script, the Debug Logging module, encapsulated within the `debug_logging.py` file, stands as a beacon of illumination, casting light upon the darkest corners of the code's execution. This module, far more than a simple mechanism for outputting text, is a sophisticated system designed to provide deep insights into the script's operation, facilitate troubleshooting, and serve as an indispensable tool for both developers and end-users alike.

### The Philosophy of Logging in Software Development

Before delving into the specifics of our Debug Logging module, it's crucial to understand the philosophy underpinning its design. In the realm of software development, particularly in complex systems like our Language Translator, logging is not merely a convenience—it is a fundamental pillar of robust, maintainable, and debuggable code. It serves as the eyes and ears of the developer, providing visibility into the often opaque world of program execution.

The art of logging is a delicate balance. Too little logging, and one is left fumbling in the dark when issues arise. Too much, and one risks drowning in a sea of information, unable to discern the signal from the noise. Our Debug Logging module aims to strike this balance, providing comprehensive insights when needed, while remaining unobtrusive during normal operation.

### The Logger Class: A Symphony of Information

At the heart of the Debug Logging module lies the Logger class, a masterpiece of software engineering that orchestrates the collection, formatting, and output of log information. This class is not merely a conduit for text; it is a sophisticated system that categorizes, prioritizes, and contextualizes information flowing through the Language Translator script.

#### Initialization: Setting the Stage

When a Logger object is instantiated, it performs a series of crucial setup operations, each meticulously designed to ensure optimal logging performance:

1. **Log Level Determination**:
   The Logger class accepts a `debug_mode` parameter upon initialization. This seemingly simple boolean flag has far-reaching implications for the behavior of the entire logging system. When `debug_mode` is True, the logger opens the floodgates of information, capturing even the most minute details of the script's operation. When False, it adopts a more reserved stance, reporting only information crucial for normal operation monitoring.

   ```python
   def __init__(self, debug_mode: bool = False):
       self.debug_mode = debug_mode
       self.log_level = logging.DEBUG if debug_mode else logging.INFO
       # ... (more initialization code)
   ```

2. **Log Formatter Configuration**:
   The formatting of log messages is an art form in itself. Our Logger class implements a custom formatter that goes beyond simple text output. Each log entry is a rich tapestry of information, including:
   - Timestamp: Precise to the millisecond, allowing for detailed temporal analysis of events.
   - Log Level: A hierarchical categorization (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) that allows for quick visual parsing of log importance.
   - Thread ID: In our multi-threaded environment, this is crucial for tracing the flow of execution across different threads.
   - File Name and Line Number: Pinpointing the exact location in the codebase where each log entry originates.
   - Message: The actual log content, carefully crafted to be informative yet concise.

   ```python
   formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - [Thread %(thread)d] - %(filename)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s')
   ```

3. **Output Stream Configuration**:
   The Logger class is designed with flexibility in mind when it comes to output destinations. By default, it writes to both a log file (for permanent record-keeping) and to the console (for real-time monitoring). The log file is automatically named with a timestamp, ensuring that each run of the script produces a unique, easily identifiable log file.

   ```python
   file_handler = logging.FileHandler(f'language_translator_{datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")}.log')
   console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
   ```

#### Logging Methods: A Spectrum of Verbosity

The Logger class provides a rich set of methods for logging at different levels of importance and detail. Each method is carefully designed to serve a specific purpose in the grand narrative of the script's execution:

1. **debug(message: str)**:
   This method is the most verbose, designed for capturing fine-grained details of the script's operation. It's particularly useful for tracing the flow of execution, variable states, and decision points within the code. In normal operation, these messages are suppressed, but they become invaluable when troubleshooting complex issues.

   ```python
   def debug(self, message: str):
       if self.debug_mode:
           self.logger.debug(message)
   ```

2. **info(message: str)**:
   The info method is for recording normal operational events. These messages provide a high-level overview of the script's progress, such as the start and completion of major tasks, successful API calls, or the processing of individual files.

3. **warning(message: str)**:
   Warnings are used to flag potential issues that don't necessarily prevent the script from functioning but may indicate suboptimal conditions. This could include things like unexpected but handleable data formats, or approaching (but not exceeding) API rate limits.

4. **error(message: str)**:
   Error logging is for capturing significant issues that impede the normal operation of the script. This could include API failures, file access problems, or unexpected data inconsistencies. Error logs often indicate situations that require immediate attention or investigation.

5. **critical(message: str)**:
   The highest level of logging, critical messages indicate severe issues that may prevent the script from continuing its operation. These could include unrecoverable errors, such as complete API unavailability or critical resource exhaustion.

### Advanced Features: Beyond Basic Logging

The Debug Logging module goes far beyond simple message output, incorporating advanced features that elevate it to a crucial component of the Language Translator script's architecture:

1. **Context Managers for Timed Operations**:
   The Logger class implements context managers that allow for easy timing and logging of operations. This is particularly useful for performance profiling and identifying bottlenecks in the translation process.

   ```python
   @contextmanager
   def log_time(self, operation_name: str):
       start_time = time.time()
       yield
       elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
       self.info(f"{operation_name} completed in {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
   ```

   Usage of this context manager allows for elegant and informative timing logs:

   ```python
   with logger.log_time("File processing"):
       process_file(file_path)
   ```

2. **Adaptive Verbosity**:
   The logging system is designed to adapt its verbosity based on the current state of the script. For example, during normal operation, it might log only high-level information. However, if it detects repeated errors or unusual patterns, it can automatically increase its verbosity to capture more detailed information for troubleshooting.

3. **Log Rotation and Archiving**:
   To prevent log files from growing unwieldy, the Logger implements a log rotation system. After a certain size threshold is reached, the current log file is archived, and a new one is started. This ensures that log files remain manageable while still preserving a comprehensive history of the script's operation.

4. **Structured Logging Support**:
   In addition to traditional text-based logging, the Logger class supports structured logging formats like JSON. This makes it easier to parse and analyze logs programmatically, opening up possibilities for automated log analysis and alerting systems.

5. **Integration with External Monitoring Systems**:
   The Logger is designed with hooks that allow for easy integration with external monitoring and alerting systems. Critical errors can trigger immediate notifications, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly.

### Error Handling and Resilience

The Debug Logging module is designed with robustness as a primary concern. It implements several features to ensure that logging itself never becomes a point of failure for the script:

1. **Fail-Safe Operation**:
   If the Logger encounters any issues with writing to its primary log file (e.g., due to disk space issues or permission problems), it automatically falls back to a secondary logging mechanism. This could be writing to a different directory or, in extreme cases, logging only to the console.

2. **Error Suppression in Production**:
   While comprehensive logging is crucial for development and troubleshooting, in production environments, the Logger is configured to suppress certain types of errors related to its own operation. This prevents the logging system from flooding the logs with meta-errors about logging failures.

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   In scenarios where system resources are constrained, the Logger can detect these conditions and gracefully degrade its functionality. For example, it might reduce the frequency of certain types of log messages or temporarily disable some of its more resource-intensive features.

### Performance Considerations

Given the critical nature of the translation process, the Debug Logging module is designed to have minimal impact on the overall performance of the script:

1. **Asynchronous Logging**:
   For non-critical log messages, the Logger employs asynchronous writing techniques. This allows the main thread to continue execution without waiting for log writes to complete, significantly reducing any potential performance impact.

2. **Buffered Writing**:
   The Logger implements a buffered writing system for file outputs. Instead of writing each log message individually, it collects messages in a buffer and writes them in batches. This reduces the number of I/O operations, improving overall system performance.

3. **Conditional Compilation**:
   In performance-critical sections of the code, the Logger uses conditional compilation techniques. This allows certain debug log statements to be completely removed from the compiled code in production builds, ensuring zero performance overhead for these logs.

### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

The Debug Logging module is designed with the future in mind, incorporating several features that allow for easy extension and enhancement:

1. **Plugin Architecture**:
   The Logger class implements a plugin architecture that allows for easy addition of new logging backends or formatters. This makes it simple to adapt the logging system to new requirements or integrate with new monitoring tools.

2. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   Future versions of the Logger could incorporate machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous patterns in log data, potentially identifying issues before they become critical.

3. **Interactive Debugging Interface**:
   Plans are in place to develop an interactive debugging interface that would allow users to dynamically adjust logging levels and filters in real-time, providing unprecedented visibility into the script's operation.

In conclusion, the Debug Logging module of the Language Translator script is far more than a simple system for outputting text. It is a sophisticated, robust, and extensible framework that provides crucial insights into the script's operation, facilitates troubleshooting, and serves as a foundation for ongoing development and optimization. Its careful design and implementation ensure that it serves its critical role without compromising the performance or reliability of the main translation tasks.

## Statistics Management: statistics_management.py

In the intricate ecosystem of the Language Translator script, the Statistics Management module, encapsulated within the `statistics_management.py` file, stands as a testament to the power of data-driven decision making and performance optimization. This module is not merely a collection of counters and metrics; it is a sophisticated system that breathes life into raw numbers, transforming them into actionable insights. By meticulously tracking, analyzing, and reporting on various aspects of the translation process, this module serves as the script's nervous system, providing real-time feedback on its health, efficiency, and overall performance. It empowers developers and users alike with the knowledge to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and continuously improve the translation pipeline. The Statistics Management module is the silent guardian of the script's efficiency, tirelessly working in the background to ensure that every API call, every cache interaction, and every translation operation is accounted for and analyzed in the grand tapestry of the script's execution.

### StatisticsManager Class: The Nexus of Numerical Narratives

At the heart of the Statistics Management module lies the StatisticsManager class, a marvel of software engineering that transforms the chaotic flood of events and operations within the script into a coherent, insightful narrative. This class is not merely a repository of numbers; it is a dynamic, intelligent system that collects, processes, and interprets data in real-time, providing a comprehensive view of the script's performance across multiple dimensions.

#### Initialization: Laying the Foundation for Data-Driven Insights

When a StatisticsManager object springs to life, it embarks on a meticulous process of preparation, ensuring that it's ready to capture every nuance of the script's operation:

1. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   The manager initializes a complex, multi-layered data structure designed to capture a wide array of statistics. This structure is carefully crafted to balance between granularity of data and efficiency of storage and retrieval:

   ```python
   def __init__(self, stats_file: str):
       self.stats_file = stats_file
       self.stats = {
           'general': {
               'script_execution_count': 0,
               'total_files_processed': 0,
               'total_translations': 0,
           },
           'api_usage': {
               'anthropic': {'calls': 0, 'tokens': 0},
               'openai': {'calls': 0, 'tokens': 0},
           },
           'cache': {
               'hits': 0,
               'misses': 0,
               'additions': 0,
           },
           'performance': {
               'average_translation_time': 0,
               'peak_memory_usage': 0,
           },
           'errors': {
               'api_errors': 0,
               'file_processing_errors': 0,
           }
       }
       self.lock = threading.Lock()
       self._load_statistics()
   ```

   This intricate structure allows for the capture of general execution metrics, API-specific usage statistics, cache performance indicators, overall performance metrics, and error tracking. Each category is carefully designed to provide a comprehensive view of its respective domain.

2. **Persistent Storage Setup**:
   The manager establishes a connection with a persistent storage mechanism, typically a JSON file, to ensure that valuable statistical data is not lost between script executions. This feature allows for long-term trend analysis and historical performance tracking:

   ```python
   def _load_statistics(self):
       try:
           with open(self.stats_file, 'r') as f:
               saved_stats = json.load(f)
               self.stats.update(saved_stats)
       except FileNotFoundError:
           self.logger.info("No existing statistics file found. Starting with fresh statistics.")
       except json.JSONDecodeError:
           self.logger.error("Error decoding statistics file. Starting with fresh statistics.")
   ```

   This method not only loads existing statistics but also implements robust error handling to ensure that the script can continue operating even if the statistics file is corrupted or missing.

3. **Concurrency Safeguards**:
   In recognition of the script's multi-threaded nature, the StatisticsManager implements thread-safe operations using a lock mechanism. This ensures that statistical updates remain accurate and consistent even in the face of concurrent operations:

   ```python
   self.lock = threading.Lock()
   ```

   This lock is utilized in all methods that modify the statistics, ensuring data integrity in a multi-threaded environment.

#### Core Functionality: The Art of Statistical Aggregation

The StatisticsManager class offers a rich tapestry of methods designed to capture, update, and analyze various aspects of the script's operation:

1. **Incremental Statistic Updates**:
   The manager provides a suite of methods for incrementing various statistics. These methods are designed to be atomic, thread-safe operations that ensure accurate tracking even in high-concurrency scenarios:

   ```python
   def increment_stat(self, category: str, stat: str, value: int = 1):
       with self.lock:
           if category in self.stats and stat in self.stats[category]:
               self.stats[category][stat] += value
           else:
               self.logger.warning(f"Attempted to increment unknown stat: {category}.{stat}")
   ```

   This method showcases the manager's flexibility, allowing for the incrementation of any statistic in any category, while also implementing error checking to catch potential misuse.

2. **Complex Metric Calculations**:
   Beyond simple counters, the StatisticsManager implements methods for calculating complex metrics that provide deeper insights into the script's performance:

   ```python
   def calculate_api_averages(self):
       with self.lock:
           anthropic_calls = self.stats['api_usage']['anthropic']['calls']
           openai_calls = self.stats['api_usage']['openai']['calls']
           total_calls = anthropic_calls + openai_calls
           
           if total_calls == 0:
               return "No API calls made yet."
           
           anthropic_percentage = (anthropic_calls / total_calls) * 100
           openai_percentage = (openai_calls / total_calls) * 100
           
           return f"API Usage: Anthropic: {anthropic_percentage:.2f}%, OpenAI: {openai_percentage:.2f}%"
   ```

   This method, for example, calculates the relative usage of different APIs, providing valuable insights into API preferences and potential optimization opportunities.

3. **Performance Tracking**:
   The manager implements sophisticated methods for tracking performance metrics over time, allowing for the identification of performance trends and potential bottlenecks:

   ```python
   def update_performance_metric(self, metric: str, value: float):
       with self.lock:
           if metric in self.stats['performance']:
               current_value = self.stats['performance'][metric]
               self.stats['performance'][metric] = (current_value + value) / 2  # Running average
           else:
               self.logger.warning(f"Attempted to update unknown performance metric: {metric}")
   ```

   This method showcases how the manager can track running averages of performance metrics, providing a smoothed view of the script's performance over time.

4. **Error Tracking and Analysis**:
   The StatisticsManager plays a crucial role in error tracking and analysis, providing methods to log and analyze various types of errors encountered during script execution:

           cache_total = cache_hits + cache_misses
           if cache_total > 0:
               hit_rate = (cache_hits / cache_total) * 100
               report += f"  Hit Rate: {hit_rate:.2f}%\n"
           
           report += f"\nPerformance Metrics:\n"
           for metric, value in self.stats['performance'].items():
               report += f"  {metric.replace('_', ' ').title()}: {value}\n"
           
           report += f"\nError Summary:\n"
           for error_type, count in self.stats['errors'].items():
               report += f"  {error_type}: {count}\n"
           
           return report
   ```

   This comprehensive report provides a holistic view of the script's performance, covering everything from general execution statistics to detailed API usage and error summaries.

2. **Trend Analysis**:

   ```python
   def analyze_performance_trend(self, metric: str, time_range: int):
       # Implementation of trend analysis
       pass
   ```

   This method (to be implemented) would analyze the trend of a specific performance metric over a given time range, potentially using techniques like moving averages or regression analysis.

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   Leveraging its wealth of historical data, the StatisticsManager can implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns or sudden changes in performance metrics:

   ```python
   def detect_anomalies(self):
       # Implementation of anomaly detection
       pass
   ```

   This feature could use statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms to identify anomalous behavior, alerting developers to potential issues before they become critical.

4. **Predictive Analytics**:
   By analyzing historical trends and patterns, the StatisticsManager can implement predictive models to forecast future performance or resource needs:

   ```python
   def predict_resource_needs(self, time_horizon: int):
       # Implementation of predictive analytics
       pass
   ```

   This advanced feature could help in capacity planning and proactive optimization of the script's resources.

#### Error Handling and Resilience

The StatisticsManager implements robust error handling to ensure that statistical tracking never becomes a point of failure for the main script:

1. **Graceful Degradation**:
   If the manager encounters issues with updating or storing statistics, it implements a graceful degradation strategy. It will log the error and continue operating with reduced functionality rather than causing the entire script to fail.

2. **Data Integrity Checks**:
   The manager implements regular data integrity checks to ensure that the statistics remain accurate and consistent:

   ```python
   def verify_data_integrity(self):
       with self.lock:
           # Perform various consistency checks
           pass
   ```

   This method would check for inconsistencies in the data, such as negative counters or impossible ratios, and attempt to correct them or alert the user if serious discrepancies are found.

3. **Backup and Recovery**:
   To protect against data loss, the StatisticsManager implements a backup and recovery system:

   ```python
   def create_backup(self):
       with self.lock:
           backup_file = f"{self.stats_file}.backup"
           with open(backup_file, 'w') as f:
               json.dump(self.stats, f)
   
   def recover_from_backup(self):
       backup_file = f"{self.stats_file}.backup"
       try:
           with open(backup_file, 'r') as f:
               self.stats = json.load(f)
           self.logger.info("Successfully recovered statistics from backup.")
       except FileNotFoundError:
           self.logger.error("No backup file found for recovery.")
   ```

   These methods ensure that statistical data can be recovered even in the event of file corruption or accidental deletion.

2. **Batched Updates**:
   For performance-critical sections of the code, the manager supports batched updates to reduce the number of lock acquisitions and releases:

   ```python
   def batch_update(self, updates: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]]):
       with self.lock:
           for category, stats in updates.items():
               for stat, value in stats.items():
                   if category in self.stats and stat in self.stats[category]:
                       self.stats[category][stat] += value
   ```

   This method allows for multiple statistics to be updated in a single, atomic operation, reducing contention in multi-threaded scenarios.

3. **Asynchronous Persistence**:
   The manager implements asynchronous persistence of statistics to disk, ensuring that I/O operations do not block the main translation process:

   ```python
   def save_statistics_async(self):
       threading.Thread(target=self._save_statistics).start()
   ```

   This method spawns a separate thread to handle the saving of statistics, allowing the main thread to continue its work uninterrupted.

#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

   def execute_plugin(self, plugin_name: str, *args, **kwargs):
       if plugin_name in self.plugins:
           return self.plugins[plugin_name](*args, **kwargs)
       else:
           self.logger.error(f"Attempted to execute unknown plugin: {plugin_name}")
   ```

   This architecture allows for the easy integration of new statistical measures or analysis techniques without modifying the core StatisticsManager code.

2. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   Future versions of the StatisticsManager could incorporate machine learning algorithms for more advanced trend analysis and prediction:

   ```python
   def train_ml_model(self, model_type: str):
       # Implementation of ML model training
       pass
   
   def predict_with_ml_model(self, model_type: str, input_data: Dict):
       # Implementation of ML-based prediction
       pass
   ```

   These methods would allow for the integration of machine learning models to provide more sophisticated insights and predictions based on the collected statistics.

3. **Real-time Monitoring Interface**:
   Plans are in place to develop a real-time monitoring interface that would allow users to view live statistics and performance metrics as the script runs:

   ```python
   def start_real_time_monitor(self):
       # Implementation of real-time monitoring server
       pass
   ```

   This feature would provide unprecedented visibility into the script's operation, allowing for real-time decision making and optimization.

In conclusion, the Statistics Management module of the Language Translator script is a sophisticated system that transforms raw operational data into actionable insights. Its careful design and implementation ensure that it provides valuable performance metrics and analysis without compromising the efficiency of the main translation tasks. As the script evolves, the StatisticsManager will continue to play a crucial role in optimizing performance, identifying issues, and driving continuous improvement in the translation process.

## Localization Writing: localization_writer.py

In the intricate ecosystem of your Language Translator script, the Localization Writing module, encapsulated within the `localization_writer.py` file, stands as the crucial final step in the translation process. This module is not merely a simple mechanism for writing text to files; it is a sophisticated system that ensures the seamless integration of newly translated content into the existing structure of the game's localization files. The Localization Writing module serves as the bridge between the raw translated text and the game's linguistic landscape, carefully preserving the intricate format and structure of the original files while updating them with the new translations.

The heart of this module is the LocalizationWriter class, a meticulously crafted component that handles the delicate task of integrating translated text into the game's localization files. This class is designed with a deep understanding of the unique challenges posed by game localization, including the need to maintain specific file structures, handle various text encodings, and ensure that the translated content fits seamlessly into the game's existing text systems.

By continuously monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the translation process, it plays a crucial role in maintaining peak performance and enabling your team to handle even the most demanding localization tasks with confidence and precision.









You are a Master Python Developer that uses phrases that a common person would imagine a zen or buddhist monk to say. You stay on context by not making changes I don't specifically ask for and you'll help create new highly complex and robust Python scripts. You'll have a tendency to be brief in your explanations and consolidate the code you provide me so that all changes for a single file are presented at the same time. If you need to provide me code blocks spanning two files, you should way for my go ahead in between.

## Lessons Learned 

1. API Interaction:
   - Always use try-except blocks when making API calls to handle potential errors gracefully.
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid hitting API request limits.
   - Cache API responses to reduce unnecessary calls and improve performance.
   - Use a wrapper function for API calls to handle timeouts and interruptions.

2. File Handling:
   - Use 'with' statements when opening files to ensure they are properly closed after use.
   - Always specify the encoding (e.g., utf-8) when reading/writing files to avoid encoding issues.
   - Use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility when dealing with file paths.

3. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling to make the script more robust.
   - Use logging to record important events and errors for easier debugging.
   - Consider different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) for various scenarios.
   - Implement graceful handling of KeyboardInterrupt (CTRL-C) to allow clean script termination.

4. User Interface:
   - Always add command-line arguments for greater flexibility and control.
   - Use rich library for enhanced console output and formatting.

5. Code Structure and Maintainability:
   - Break down complex operations into smaller, reusable functions.
   - Use @versioned decorator on the main function to keep track of the version of the script.
   - Increment the main function version decorator when making significant changes to the script.
   - Use @versioned decorator on all functions and try to keep in-line with the main function's version.
   - Use type hints to improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors.
   - Write docstrings for functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Use batch processing of languages when possible to reduce the number of API calls.
   - Implement pickle caching mechanism to store and reuse language translations.
   - Profile the code to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
   - Use threading to improve performance.

7. Version Control:
   - As changes to functions are made, update the version number in the @versioned decorator using the main function version as a reference point.
   - Ensure the version number always goes up, never down.
   - As major changes to the script are made, update the version number in the @versioned decorator on the main function.
   - Document major lessons learned in the docstring section of the function.

8. Documentation:
   - All functions should have a docstring that describes what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.
   - Keep this large comment header block up-to-date with the latest changes and features.
   - Automatically maintain a per-function changelog within the function's docstring or comment block to track significant updates and modifications.
   - Add detailed docstrings to all functions, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

9. Security:
    - Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys directly in the script.
    - Use environment variables or secure configuration files to store sensitive data.
    - Implement proper input validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

10. Continuous Improvement:
    - Regularly identify and call out areas for potential refactoring or optimization. Only propose the improvement.
    - Do not update code without also updating the documentation.

11. Error Recovery and Resilience:
    - Implement mechanisms to recover from errors and continue processing where possible.
    - Consider using checkpoints to save progress in long-running operations.
    - Implement proper cleanup procedures for when the script is interrupted or encounters errors.
    - Implement multi-pronged or conditional strategies that better handle multiple outlying conditions.
    - Anywhere we input or output data, we should validate the data to ensure it is in the correct format.

12. Handling Interruptions:
    - Implement robust interrupt handling, especially for long-running processes.
    - Consider using signal handlers to catch and handle interrupts gracefully.
    - Ensure that interrupts are handled at all levels of the script, including within API calls.

13. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
    - Implement debug log --debug CLI argument to aid in debugging complex issues. Also include stack track on --debug only.
    - Use try-except blocks judiciously to catch and log specific errors without halting execution.
    - Generally hide problems, unless you are running --debug

14. Configuration Management:
    - Utilize a config.py file to set any global variables or configuration parameters
    - Ensure each time we add a library dependency, we update the check_dependencies() function. These libraries should be stored in this config.py file.

15. Backwards Compatibility:
    - When making significant changes, consider the impact on existing data.

16. Resource Management:
    - Implement proper resource cleanup, especially for network connections and file handles.
    - Use context managers (with statements) where appropriate to ensure resources are released.
    - Be mindful of memory usage, especially when processing large datasets.

17. Cross-platform Compatibility:
    - Use os-agnostic path handling (e.g., pathlib) and avoid hardcoded file separators.
    - Be aware of differences in system calls and available libraries across platforms.

18. Code Reusability and Modularity:
    - Design functions and classes with reusability in mind.
    - Consider creating separate modules for distinct functionalities.
    - Use dependency injection where appropriate to improve modularity and testability.

19. Performance Monitoring:
    - Implement basic performance metrics (e.g., execution time, resource usage).

20. Dependency Management:
    - Always add new import modules to the dependency checker function.
    - When adding a new library or module, update both the imports and the 
      check_dependencies() function to ensure all dependencies are properly verified.
    - This practice helps catch missing dependencies early and provides clear 
      instructions to users about what needs to be installed.

Add above lessons learned to your rules.

PROJECT DETAILS FOR LANGUAGETRANSLATOR.PY:

Our journey today is to create a script called languageTranslator.py that will be used to recursively locate Localization.txt files for a game called 7 Days to Due. It will read in this file and translate all of the english text to all of the other languages listed in the header of the file. This script's job is to do this language translation effectively utilizing both Anthropic and ChatGPT APIs, and while storing it in a pickle cache to ensure we don't make repeat queries to the API. Our script will handle values that contain both " and \n so will need to handle the writing of the destination Localization.translated.txt file manually and not using a CSV parser.

# Features:
* languageTranslator.py will be the main script.
* Support for both Anthropic & ChatGPT APIs and will automatically alternate between them.
    * Supports continuation of previous query should you go over the maximum message length.
    * Automatic retry on failure. 
    * On parse errors, will print the raw message back to the screen via debug log.
    * Smart enabling of ChatGPT or Anthropic API simply by setting environmental variables CHATGPT_API_KEY & ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Will automatically validate the API KEYs and disable the ones that are not valid.
    * Rate limiting for API calls so when we multithread, we don't get rate limited by the API.
    * Both Prompts and Responses utilize JSON to ensure that the API responses are correctly parsed.
* Two batching strategies (Token Estimation & Single Language Translation) and will automatically alternate between them.
    * For Token Estimation: Intelligently estimates tokens for both prompt and responses to determine the maximum number of languages that can be processed in a single query.
    * For Single Language Translation: Processes one language at a time.
* Smart caching to pickle the API responses to prevent duplicate API queries.
    * Caches the individual english->target_language translations to pickle cache. Uses this to determine which languages still need to be translated.
* Intelligent Python Module Dependency Management
    * Built in dependency checker that makes sure all necessary Python modules are installed before the scripts is allowed to run.
    * Will provide instructions on how to install the necessary Python modules when they are not found.

# High-Level Flow:
1. Recursively search for all Localization.txt files in the directory tree starting from the source path
2. Count the number of entries in each Localization.txt file
3. Each thread in this multithreaded script will process a separate Localization.txt file, but will have its own "Per File" Progress Bar
4. As each separate Localization.txt file is processed, the "Overall Progress" Progress Bar will be update. All entries are saved in a local pickle cache.
5. As each row in the Localization.txt is read in to be processed, the english value is used to translate to all other languages.
6. Proper escaping and formatting is applied and a new Localization.translated.txt file is created with the translated values.

# Code Segregation:
The code for this script should be broken down into different files to segregate the code into different modules:
* Main Script (languageTranslator.py) : Contains the main function and the entry point for the script, and CLI argument parsing.
* Configuration (config.py) : All constants and global variables should be stored here
* API & Logging (api_logging.py)
* Batch Management (batch_management.py)
* Cache Management (cache_management.py)
* Statistics Management (statistics_management.py)
* Localization.txt Writing (localization_writing.py)

Please suggest any others if you see another segregation category that might be appropriate.

## Main Script
* CLI arguments to support:
    * First argument should be the source path. If no path is provided, the script should use the current directory as the source path.
    * --debug : For enabling debug mode.
    * --help : For displaying the help message.
    * --cache-details : For displaying the detailed cache statistics.
    * --cache-clear N : For clearing N random entries from the cache.
    * --cache-wipe : For wiping the entire cache.

## Configuration
Below contains some variables that we need to set for the script to run correctly:
* MAX_ALLOWED_TOKENS : For setting the maximum number of tokens allowed in a single API call.
* MAX_TOKENS : For setting the maximum number of tokens allowed in a single API call.


## API & Logging:
* Implement API Management as a Class
    * APIKeyValidation : For validating the API keys
    * APITranslate : Make a call to the API to translate text for one or more languages.\
    * JSONClean : For cleaning the JSON responses from the API to ensure that they are correctly parsed.
        * Should strip off any leading strings from the JSON response, up to the { character
        * Should attempt to clean up any badly formatted JSON.
    * APIAlternate : For forcefully switching between the two APIs
* Implement Normal & Debug Logging as a Class
    * DebugLog : For logging debug information to the screen. Should include Date & Time, DEBUG, Thread ID, and the message.
    * NormalLog : For logging normal information to the screen. Should include Date & Time, INFO, Thread ID, and the message.
* Implement Graceful CTRL-C Handler that will write out the cache entry, display current progress to the screen and then exit the script.

## Batch Management
* Must inherently support multithreading, with each thread handling its own Localization.txt file to process.
* Should have an uppercase global variable set that determins the maximum number of threads that can be run at one time.
* The translation should immediately be written out to the pickle cache to ensure preservation of the paid translation.
* Implement the EntryProcessor as a Class : Used to consolidate actions that we know are taken each time we process an entry from a Localization.txt file we are translating.
    * MissingLanguageCount : For counting the number of languages that still need to be translated.
    * MissingLanguages : For retrieving the list of languages that still need to be translated.
    * CollectTranslations : For collecting the translations from the APIs.
    * SanityCleanup : For ensuring that the translations are correctly parsed and escaped.
    * WriteOutTranslations : For writing out the translations to the Localization.translated.txt file.
    * WriteOutStatistics : For writing out any new statistics from this entry to the pickle cache.
    * WriteOutCache : For writing out one language translated to the pickle cache.
* Implements the Estimation-Based Batching Strategy & Single Language Translation Strategy as two separate classes.
    * Estimation-Based Batching Strategy : For processing multiple languages at a time.
        * This methodology must initially run through all languages and attempt to estimate the tokens for the response for each, while staying under the MAX_ALLOWED_TOKENS limit.
        * There should be debug log output to the screen that shows the how the first language is 150 tokens, the second language is 160 tokens, the third language is 170 tokens, etc. adding up to the total number of tokens estimated across all languages. Through this process we should determine how many languages we can process in a single batch while staying under the MAX_ALLOWED_TOKENS limit.
        * If the estimation fails, we should provide a debug log entry and then move to the Single Language Translation Strategy.
        * If the estimation succeeds, we should process the estimated number of languages in the batch in the order they were provided in the MissingLanguages list.
        * If an API call fails, we should reduce the batch size by half and retry. If after 3 retries the batch still fails, then move to the Single Language Translation Strategy.
        * Continue looping over the MissingLanguages list until all languages are processed, then WriteOutTranslations & WriteOutStatistics.
    * Single Language Translation Strategy : For processing one language at a time.
        * This methodology must process one language at a time, while staying under the MAX_ALLOWED_TOKENS limit.
        * If an API call fails, we should move to the next language in the MissingLanguages list.
        * If an API call succeeds: Continue looping over the MissingLanguages list until all languages are processed, then WriteOutTranslations & WriteOutStatistics.
    * Seamless switching between the two strategies based on the API response retaining all partial language translations

### Two-Tier Processing Batching Strategies

Each entry that the parser reads in from a Localization.txt file starts with the Estimation strategy and moves to the Single Language Translation Strategy if the estimation fails. Because this script is multithreaded, each thread will work through its own Localization.txt file and will not interfere with the other threads.
* Estimation of tokens per language translation to intelligently determine how many languages to process in a single batch
Note: The idea is for this automatic estimation to query the API with as many languages as possible while staying under the MAX_ALLOWED_TOKENS limit. 
    * The estimation for the overall translation tokens (prompt + response) is taken without making any call to the API and is printed to the screen with debug_log
    * Each iteration of this loop, how many languages are processed is printed to the screen with debug_log
    * If a batch fails, reduce the batch size by half and retry
    * If after 3 retries the batch still fails, then move to Single Language Translation Strategy
* Single Language Translation Strategy
    * The batch size is 1 - Only one language is processed at a time
    * If after 3 retries the language still fails, then skip that language
    
* There is a master loop around the entire entry or key that ensures that all languages are processed
* The script should be able to alternate freely back and forth between Anthropic and ChatGPT
* As it switches back and forth between APIs and batching strategies, it should keep track of which languages we have translations for to automatically detect which remaining languages are left to translate

## Cache Management:
* Cache is stored in the pickle format.
* Implement Cache as a Class
    * Encode & Decode Functions : For handling the base64 encoding
    * StoreTranslation & GetTranslation Functions : For Cache Management
        * GetTranslation should allow you to pass it either the english text as the key which would return all language translations, or optionally provide a second argument to the function to retrieve a specific language translation.
        * StoreTranslation should remove and leading or trailing whitespace from the key or value. This should be default extra bit that it does.
    * StoreStatistic & GetStatistic Functions : For storing or retrieving a specific statistic
        * GetStatistics should return the current statistics from the cache.
    * WriteOutCache & ReadFromCache Functions : For Writing out the cache & Reading from the cache
* All keys and values should be stored with base64 encoding to prevent any issues with special characters.
* Statistics should be stored in a dictionary format within the pickle cache.
* Language translation cache should be stored in a dictionary format within the pickle cache.

## Statistics Management:
* Implement Statistics as a Class
    * SetStat, GetStat function : For setting or getting a specific statistic in the pickle cache.
    * IncrementState function : Increment a statistic by 1
    * Variables as part of class:
    files_processed: int = 0
    entries_translated: int = 0
    api_success: int = 0
    api_fail: int = 0
    api_time: float = 0.0
    cache_hits: int = 0
    cache_misses: int = 0
    size_history: List[Tuple[float, int]] = field(default_factory=list)
    execution_count: int = 0
    total_prompt_tokens: int = 0
    total_response_tokens: int = 0    
    total_translations: int = 0  # Add this line

## Localization.txt
### Writing Standards:
* The standard header at the top of all Localization.txt files is as follows:
Key,File,Type,UsedInMainMenu,NoTranslate,english,Context / Alternate Text,german,latam,french,italian,japanese,koreana,polish,brazilian,russian,turkish,schinese,tchinese,spanish
* The following fields/columns should have double quote around non-null values:
english,Context / Alternate Text,german,latam,french,italian,japanese,koreana,polish,brazilian,russian,turkish,schinese,tchinese,spanish
* Linefeed should be presented in the value as \n
* We need to plan for and expect " & \n both to show up in the value.

### Code that Creates Localization.txt:
* We need to create our own function that manually creates the Localization.txt file without using a CSV parser.
    * This function should handle adding double quote around all values expected to have double quotes


## Examples
### ChatGPT Querying
import os
from openai import OpenAI, OpenAIError
client = OpenAI()
OpenAI.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

try:
  # Make your OpenAI API request here
  response = client.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
    prompt="Say this is a test"
  )
  print(response)
except OpenAIError as e:
  # Handle all OpenAI API errors
  print(f"Error: {e}")

### Anthropic Querying
import anthropic
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

try:
    client.messages.create(
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello, Claude",
            }
        ],
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    )
except anthropic.APIConnectionError as e:
    print("The server could not be reached")
    print(e.__cause__)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within httpx.
except anthropic.RateLimitError as e:
    print("A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.")
except anthropic.APIStatusError as e:
    print("Another non-200-range status code was received")
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.response)

Provide me actual code to be stored into new files you name using the code segregation section at the top. Be sure to double check it against each and every line and detail from this document. It is really important that you generate me code that precisely matches above.
